Camoto: Classic-game Modding Tools

Camoto is a collection of utilities for editing (modding) "classic games",
those from the early to mid 1990s.

This is libgamecommon, the lowest-level component of the Camoto suite.  It
contains shared code and routines used by most of the other Camoto libraries.

It is most likely of little use to anyone other than Camoto developers,
although of course it is a prerequisite to installing the rest of the Camoto
suite!

The library currently contains the following elements:

  * stream: Replacement for C++ iostream, all other stream elements implement
    this interface.  Also includes stream_file and stream_string.

  * stream_sub: Access a subsection of another stream, transparently to the
    user of the class instance.

  * stream_seg: A stream allowing data to be inserted and removed at arbitrary
    positions within the stream, and the resulting on-disk data shuffling only
    happening once, at flush().

  * stream_filtered: Transparently filter data read from and written to the
    stream.  Filters can compress/decompress, encrypt/decrypt, etc.

  * lzss: Generic implementation of the LZSS compression algorithm, implemented
    in the form of a filter (suitable for use with stream_filtered.)

  * lzw: Generic implementation of the LZW compression algorithm, again
    implemented as a stream filter.

  * bitstream: Stream-like interface allowing reading and writing of individual
    bits.  Used by the LZW algorithm which initially reads data in units of
    9-bits.

  * iostream_helpers: Helper classes to simplify reading and writing data in a
    platform neutral manner.  "stream << u32le(123)" will write the number 123
    as a 32-bit unsigned little-endian integer regardless of the endian-ness of
    the host platform, and likewise "uint16_t i; stream >> u16be(i);" will read
    a 16-bit big-endian integer from the stream.

Each element contains a number of tests to confirm it is working as expected,
and these are run in the usual manner: "make check"

The library is compiled and installed in the usual way:

  ./configure && make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig

If you downloaded the git release, run ./autogen.sh before the commands above.

This library is released under the GPLv3 license.
