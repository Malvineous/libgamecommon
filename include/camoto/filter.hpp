		 * A block of input data is supplied, and this function transforms it as
		 * appropriate and writes the output data into a second block.  For ease of
		 * writing filters, not all the input data has to be read, and the output
		 * buffer need only be partially filled.  The function will be called
		 * repeatedly until it signals that it has not consumed any input data and
		 * also not produced any output data.
		 *
		 * @param out
		 *   Pointer to memory where post-processed data will be stored.
		 *
		 * @param lenOut
		 *   Initially, the size of \e out (i.e. the maximum number of output
		 *   bytes.)  On return, this is set to the number of bytes that were
		 *   placed into \e out.  This will always be >= MIN_BUFFER_SIZE.
		 *
		 * @param in
		 *   Pointer to where the data needing processing is to be read from.
		 *
		 * @param lenIn
		 *   Initially, the size of \e in (i.e. the maximum number of input
		 *   bytes that can be read.)  On return, this is set to the number of
		 *   input bytes that were read.  Any remaining (unread) bytes will be
		 *   passed in on the next call.
		 *
		 *   The function can be called with this value set to zero if all the
		 *   input data has been consumed but the filter has not indicated EOF
		 *   (e.g. if it is still writing out decompressed data).
		 *
		 * @note You must signal the end of the data stream by setting lenOut
		 *   and lenIn to zero on return.  If this is not done the filter will
		 *   be called in an endless loop!
		 *
		 * @note \e in will be populated with at least a few hundred bytes, and
		 *   only less than this when reaching the end of the incoming data.
		 *   Therefore if there is not enough incoming data to produce a single
		 *   byte of output data, a filter_error should be thrown to indicate
		 *   the input data was truncated.
		 *
		 * @throw filter_error
		 *   The data was corrupted and could not be filtered.
