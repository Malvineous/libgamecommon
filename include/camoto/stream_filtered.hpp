/// Set real-size function callback (to set the prefiltered/native size)
/**
 * This function is called with an integer parameter when a stream::filtered
 * is flushed, to notify the callee of how much data was passed to the filter.
 * This can be different to the amount of data that was written out to the
 * underlying stream, such as in the case of a filter which performs
 * compression.  In this case, the number of bytes that end up in the
 * destination stream will be the compressed size of the data, and this callback
 * will be supplied with the number of bytes passed to the filter (effectively
 * the decompressed size of the data, in this case.)
 *
 * This is useful mainly for game archives, which often store both the
 * compressed and decompressed sizes of the files they contain.
 *
 * Since no other data can be passed with this function call, usually
 * std::bind is used to create a "wrapping" around some other function with
 * more parameters.
 *
 * The function signature is:
 * @code
 * void fnTruncate(stream::output_filtered* filt, stream::len new_length);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The filt parameter is the stream::filtered itself.  new_length is the new
 * "real" size, as opposed to the stored size which is obviously the number of
 * bytes actually written to the stream.
 *
 * This example uses std::bind to package up a call to the Linux
 * truncate() function (which requires both a filename and size) such that
 * the filename is supplied in advance and not required when the \e fn_truncate
 * call is made.
 *
 * @code
 * fn_truncate fnTruncate = std::bind<void>(truncate, "graphics.dat", _2);
 * // later...
 * fnTruncate(out, 123);  // calls truncate("graphics.dat", 123)
 * @endcode
 *
 * This callback is used in cases where both a file's compressed and
 * decompressed size are stored.  Here the callback will be notified with the
 * prefiltered size during the flush() call, with the postfiltered size
 * being the amount of data that was actually written to the stream.
 *
 * The callback should throw stream::write_error if the operation did not
 * succeed.
